# Enumerate all Cuts

Implementation of the method presented in:
Yeh, Li-Pu, Biing-Feng Wang, and Hsin-Hao Su. "Efficient algorithms for the problems of enumerating cuts by non-decreasing weights." Algorithmica 56.3 (2010): 297-312.

Cuts are enumerated in non-decreasing order and either the cut base or all cuts of the graph are returned.

This implementation was created in the teaching module "Fortgeschrittene Methoden der Bioinformatik" of Leipzig University during Summer Semester 2024.
