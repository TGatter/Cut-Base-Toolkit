# Enumerating Relevant Cuts

Enumerate the relevant cuts of a graph (in non-decreasing order) and return a cut base for the given graph. 

Implementations are based in concepts from:
Gusfield, Dan, and Dalit Naor. "Extracting maximal information about sets of minimum cuts." Algorithmica 10.1 (1993): 64-89.

python relevant_cut_basis_by_tree.py  {path_to_graph_file}
```
